# MCQ Quiz Application (JavaScript)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **dynamic MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Quiz Application** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**.  
It allows users to attempt a timed quiz, automatically calculates the score, and displays the final result on a separate result page.

The application is designed to demonstrate **core JavaScript concepts** such as DOM manipulation, timers, conditional logic, localStorage, and page navigation.



## 🚀 Features

- Timed MCQ quiz with automatic question navigation  
- Dynamic loading of questions and options  
- Automatic score calculation  
- Result displayed on a separate result page  
- PASS / FAIL status based on score  
- Retry quiz functionality  
- Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Quiz logic and functionality  
- **Bootstrap 5** – Responsive design and UI components

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The quiz starts with a timer for each question.
2. User selects an option and moves to the next question.
3. If the timer ends, the quiz automatically proceeds.
4. The score is calculated based on correct answers.
5. After the last question, the user is redirected to the result page.
6. The result page displays:
   - Total questions
   - Correct answers
   - Wrong answers
   - Final score
   - PASS / FAIL status

---

## 📊 Scoring Logic

- Each correct answer adds **1 point**.
- PASS criteria: **Score ≥ 50%**
- FAIL criteria: **Score < 50%**

## 🔁 Retry Quiz

The **Retry Test** button clears stored data and redirects the user back to the quiz page to attempt the test again.
