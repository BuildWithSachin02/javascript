📀 API Albums Gallery

(JavaScript Learning Project)

A responsive Albums Gallery built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which fetches album data from an external API and displays it in a modern, card-based layout.

This project is created during my JavaScript learning phase to understand API calls, JSON data, and DOM manipulation.

🚀 Project Overview

This project uses the JSONPlaceholder Albums API to fetch album data and render it dynamically on the UI.

The layout focuses on:

Clean card design

Responsive grid system

Dark modern UI

Simple and readable structure

This is a learning-focused project, not a production application.

🧠 What I Learned From This Project

What an API is and how it returns data

Difference between Albums API and Photos API

How to use fetch() in JavaScript

How to handle JSON responses

How to loop through API data using forEach

How to dynamically create HTML using JavaScript

How to design responsive layouts using CSS Grid

How UI should match the actual API data structure

🔗 API Used

JSONPlaceholder – Fake REST API for Testing

Endpoint used:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums


Each album object contains:

userId

id

title

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 – Styling, layout, responsiveness

JavaScript (ES6) – API call and DOM manipulation

Fetch API – To retrieve album data

No frameworks or libraries are used.

🎨 UI / UX Features

Responsive grid-based layout

Clean and modern dark theme

Card hover animation

Proper content hierarchy:

Album title

Album ID

User ID reference

Optimized for:

Mobile

Tablet

Desktop

⚙️ How the Project Works (Simple Flow)

Page loads in the browser

JavaScript calls the Albums API using fetch()

API returns album data in JSON format

JavaScript loops through the data

For each album:

A card is created dynamically

Album title and IDs are injected

Cards are displayed in a responsive grid layout

📸 Output Description

Displays multiple album cards

Each card shows:

Album title

Album ID

User ID

Layout automatically adjusts to screen size

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is built purely for learning purposes to strengthen:

JavaScript fundamentals

API handling and data mapping

DOM manipulation skills

Front-end layout structuring

It can be used as a beginner-level JavaScript + API project in a portfolio.

🔮 Possible Future Improvements

Connect Albums with Photos API

Show album photos on card click

Add loading spinner or skeleton UI

Add error handling (try/catch)

Limit number of albums displayed

Improve accessibility and semantics
