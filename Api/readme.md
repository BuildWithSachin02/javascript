📦 API Comments Viewer (JavaScript Learning Project)

A modern, responsive API-based comments viewer built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This project demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API and render it dynamically with a clean, professional UI.

🚀 Project Overview-

This project uses the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch comments data and display it in a glassmorphism-style card layout.

The main goal of this project is to learn and understand API concepts while practicing:

JavaScript fundamentals

fetch() API

DOM manipulation-

Responsive UI design

This is a learning-stage project, focused on clarity, structure, and best practices.

🧠 What I Learned From This Project

What an API is and how it works

How to fetch data using fetch()

How to handle JSON responses

How to loop over API data using forEach

How to create and insert HTML dynamically using JavaScript

How to structure UI for real-world API data

How to fix layout issues caused by long API text

How to design responsive layouts using CSS Grid

⚙️ How the Project Works (Simple Explanation)

JavaScript calls the API using fetch()

API returns data in JSON format

JavaScript loops through the data

For each comment:

A card is created dynamically

Data is injected into HTML

Cards are displayed in a responsive grid layout

📸 Output Preview

Displays multiple comment cards fetched live from the API
Each card shows comment details in a clean and readable format

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is created purely for learning purposes to strengthen:

JavaScript fundamentals

API handling skills

Real-world front-end data rendering

It is also suitable to be showcased as a beginner JavaScript + API project in a portfolio.

🔮 Future Improvements (Planned)

Add loading skeleton animation

Add error handling for API failure

Limit number of comments displayed

Add search or filter functionality

Add “Read More” toggle for long text

Convert to modular JavaScript
