📄 API Posts Card Viewer

(JavaScript Learning Project)

A modern, responsive Posts Viewer built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which fetches data from an external API and displays it in a clean, card-based UI.

This project is created as part of my JavaScript learning journey, focusing on understanding APIs, fetch(), and DOM manipulation.

🚀 Project Overview

This project fetches post data from the JSONPlaceholder API and dynamically renders each post as a modern UI card using JavaScript.

The UI is designed with:

Responsive grid layout

Clean typography

Dark modern theme

Smooth hover effects

The goal is to practice real-world API usage without using any frameworks.

🧠 Key Learnings From This Project

Through this project, I learned:

What an API is and how it works

How to use the Fetch API in JavaScript

How to handle and parse JSON data

How to dynamically create HTML elements using JavaScript

How to loop through API data using forEach

How to structure reusable UI components

How to design responsive layouts using CSS Grid

How to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript properly

🔗 API Used

JSONPlaceholder – Fake REST API for Testing

Endpoint:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts


Each post object contains:

userId

id

title

body

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 – Styling, layout, responsiveness

JavaScript (ES6) – API calls and DOM manipulation

Fetch API – To retrieve data from the server

No frameworks or libraries are used.

🎨 UI / UX Features

Responsive grid-based layout

Modern dark UI design

Clean card structure

Hover animation for better interaction

Optimized for:

Mobile

Tablet

Desktop

⚙️ How the Project Works (Simple Flow)

Page loads in the browser

JavaScript calls the API using fetch()

API returns post data in JSON format

JavaScript loops through the posts

For each post:

A card is created dynamically

Title, body, and user ID are injected

Cards are displayed inside a responsive grid layout

📸 Output Description

Displays multiple post cards fetched from the API

Each card shows:

Post ID

Post title

Post body

User ID reference

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is built for learning purposes to strengthen:

JavaScript fundamentals

API handling skills

DOM manipulation

Front-end UI structuring

It can also be used as a beginner-level portfolio project.

🔮 Possible Future Improvements

Limit number of posts displayed

Add loading spinner or skeleton UI

Add error handling (try/catch)

Add search or filter functionality

Add “Read More” toggle for long text

Convert code into modular functions
