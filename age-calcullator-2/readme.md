## 🚀 How It Works

1. User selects their **date of birth**
2. On button click, JavaScript:
   - Gets today’s date
   - Converts both dates into Date objects
   - Calculates the time difference
3. The difference is converted into:
   - Years
   - Months
   - Days
   - Hours
   - Minutes
   - Seconds
4. Result is displayed on the screen instantly

## 🧩 Key Learning Outcomes

- Working with **Date objects** in JavaScript
- Understanding **milliseconds to time conversion**
- Using `Math.floor()` and modulus (`%`) operator
- Handling user input and validation
- Updating the DOM dynamically

---

## ⚠️ Note

This project uses **approximate values**:
- 1 year = 365 days
- 1 month = 30 days  

This approach is **perfect for learning and practice**.  
Exact calendar-based calculation can be added later as an advanced enhancement.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- 📆 Exact calendar-based age calculation
- 🔄 Live age timer (auto-update seconds)
- 🎨 Dark / Light mode
