This project is a simple Student Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input basic details such as username, email, mobile number, and password. The form includes front-end validation logic to ensure correct data entry — including email format check, strong password validation (uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character), and 10-digit numeric phone number verification. The UI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, making it suitable for beginners learning form handling and validation.

Paragraph 2:-
The main focus of this project is JavaScript validation without using regex, so each input is checked using loops and conditional logic for better understanding. This makes the code beginner-friendly and easy to read, modify, and expand. You can use this project to learn input validation, DOM handling, error messages, and proper form interaction. Feel free to clone, modify, or improve it for practice or portfolio purposes!
